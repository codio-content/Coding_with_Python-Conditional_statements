Now let's look at another example. We can see a Flode chart on the left which asks this ...

> If the number is less than or equal to 100, output 'Small’. If the number is larger than 100 then if it is also larger than 200, output ‘Huge’ otherwise output 'Big’.

Click on the `if2.js` file tab in the left pane to see how the Javascript code would be written for this case.

## else if
Notice that we are handling the second condition using this statement

```javascript
else if (input0 > 200) {
```

This line will only execute if the first `if` condition was `false`.

Here is the general way Javascript evaluates its `if` statements.

```javascript
if ( condition1) {
  do something
}
else if ( condition2 ) {
  do something else
}
else if ( condition3 ) {
  do something else
}
else {
  otherwise do this
}
```

- The first `if` condition is evaluated. If it is true, then its code block will execute and execution will then jump to the end of all the `if / else` statements.
- If it was false, then all `else if` conditions will be evaluated in turn until one of them has a `true` condition.
- If none of the `if` or `else if` conditions evaluate to `true`, then the `else` code block will automatically execute (if it is used).
