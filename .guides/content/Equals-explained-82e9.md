The "equals" condition is typical for programming languages. Instead of using the more normal `=` to test for equality between numbers, the Python equality operator is `==` where `=` is the *assignment operator*.

Take a look at the Flode chart on the left. Below is the Python code.

```python
if number == 100:
  print('Is 100')
else:
  print('Is not 100')
```

Consider this Python code below and make you understand it.

```python
number = 10  # assign 10 to the variable number
number == 10 # test to see if number is equal to 10
```

Accidentally confusing `=` and `==` is a common beginner mistake. So watch your equals signs carefully.
