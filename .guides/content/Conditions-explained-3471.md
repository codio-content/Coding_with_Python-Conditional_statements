Take a look at the Flode chart on the left. Feel free to step through it to remind you how this works.

## Flode example
In this example, the condition is `input0 > 100`. You can see how this condition can be either true or false. These are the only possible outcomes of a decision.

You can see in the Flode chart how the chart executes according to the input value. Change the test input value to 50 and step through it. You will see exactly how Flode executes. Now change it to 200 and step through again.
