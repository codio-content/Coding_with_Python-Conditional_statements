Have a look at the Flode chart on the left. This contains 2 conditional blocks where you can see `and` and `or` being used.

Experiment by changing the Flode chart input value and have a look at the different paths the execution of the program takes. Study this carefully, it will help you to understand how logical operators work.

On the next page, have a look at the equivalent code in Python.
